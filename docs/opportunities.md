# Opportunities Management

The Opportunities module is the heart of ClientWave's sales pipeline management. It allows you to track potential customers from initial contact through conversion, ensuring no opportunity falls through the cracks.

## Understanding Opportunities

An opportunity represents a potential project or sale with a prospective client. Each opportunity contains:
- Client contact information
- Project details and requirements
- Value and timeline expectations
- Current stage in the sales process
- Historical interaction records

## Creating New Opportunities

### Manual Creation
1. Navigate to **Opportunities > New Opportunity**
2. Fill in the client contact information
3. Describe the project or service requested
4. Set the estimated value and timeline
5. Assign appropriate tags and categories
6. Select the initial stage in your sales process

### From Website Inquiry
1. Set up your website integration to feed inquiries directly into ClientWave
2. Configure lead qualification questions
3. Automatically assign new opportunities to the appropriate team member
4. Set up initial follow-up sequences

## Opportunity Stages

Configure your sales process with custom stages:

### Typical Stage Progression
1. **New Lead** - Initial inquiry received
2. **Qualified** - Basic qualification completed
3. **Proposal Sent** - Estimate/proposal delivered
4. **Negotiating** - Addressing client concerns
5. **Won** - Contract signed and project scheduled
6. **Lost** - Opportunity declined by client

### Customizing Stages
