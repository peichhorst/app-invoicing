- Recorded that Boss prefers the assistant to cover all roles with a casual tone and deleted BOOTSTRAP.
- Added header quick links and dashboard sidebar entries so /docs and /chat are easy to reach.
- Fixed dashboard prisma dynamic import to use the default export so /dashboard bookings and revenue queries load without runtime errors.
- Adjusted prisma client datasource URL builder to force pgbouncer/statement cache off and avoid prepared statement conflicts.
- Implemented JSON-string list helpers for message recipient fields, updating queries and message creation to avoid invalid Prisma list filters.
- Fixed auth entry page import to use AuthPageClient without a missing .bak2 suffix.
- Switched AuthPageClient heroWrapper typing to ReactNode to avoid React namespace issues when types resolve.
