This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Local database

Prisma migrations rely on a PostgreSQL server listening on `127.0.0.1:5433`. The easiest way to satisfy that dependency is to spin up the bundled Docker container:

```bash
docker compose up -d db
```

That creates a Postgres 18 instance with the credentials `postgres:secret` and exposes it on host port `5433`. Make sure your `.env.local` (or whatever env file you load during development) defines:

- `DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:secret@127.0.0.1:5433/postgres?schema=public"`
- `SHADOW_DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:secret@127.0.0.1:5433/prisma_shadow?schema=public"`

Once the DB is running, you can run Prisma commands such as `npx prisma migrate dev` or `npx prisma db push`. When you're done, take the database down with `docker compose down`.

If you receive `P1003: Database prisma_shadow does not exist`, create the shadow database before running Prisma:

```bash
docker exec app-invoicing-db psql -U postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE prisma_shadow;"
```

## Payment checkout

- Frontend lives at `/payment` and uses Stripe Elements for card entry.
- Required env vars (add to `.env.local`):  
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=` your Stripe publishable key  
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYMENT_API_BASE=/api/stripe/v1` (local API endpoints for `/calculate` and `/create-payment-intent`).
  - `INVOICE_ADMIN_EMAIL=petere2103@gmail.com` (optional) to receive every invoice email in addition to the customer; defaults to that address if unset.
- Restart `npm run dev` after setting env so the Stripe key is picked up.

## Reminder emails

- Define a secret for the reminder route (`INVOICE_REMINDER_SECRET=some-long-token`) and keep the same value in your scheduler.
- Trigger `POST /api/invoices/reminders` once a day (or as often as needed) with the secret either in the `x-invoice-reminder-secret` header or as a `Bearer` token. Example:

  ```bash
  curl -X POST \
    -H "x-invoice-reminder-secret: ${INVOICE_REMINDER_SECRET}" \
    https://your-app.vercel.app/api/invoices/reminders
  ```

  The endpoint sends invoices that are older than two weeks on the free plan, switches to daily reminders when the due date passes, and returns how many reminders were sent.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
